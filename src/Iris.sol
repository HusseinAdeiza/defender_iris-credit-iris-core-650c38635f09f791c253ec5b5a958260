/// TAKE
/// @dev Borrower can open multiple loans for the same intent with different quotes.
/// @dev Iris pulls the collateral from the caller via transferFrom and the bond from the solver via
/// transferFrom with a canonical Permit2 fallback, since the solver is not in the call path to stage
/// approvals. Batched approvals, permits and token wrapping are left to periphery contracts.
///
/// REPAY
/// @dev Early repay still owes fixed interest through maturity.
/// @dev Principal retired by a venue liquidation owes fixed interest only up to the rebase, not through maturity.
/// @dev Repay also closes a loan whose debt and fixedLeg are already zero but bondRequirement is
/// non-zero (for example after a venue liquidation that retired the principal and netted the fixed leg),
/// letting the solver withdraw the remaining bond.
/// @dev A borrower has no incentive to repay once the bad bond they must cover exceeds their remaining
/// collateral, since they would pay in more than they get back.
/// @dev Bad-debt loans (venue debt exceeds the debt-token value of the remaining venue collateral) can
/// still be closed permissionlessly: repay anytime, or liquidate once past maturity + overduePeriod.
/// The caller covers the venue debt to close the position.
/// @dev A borrower repay can be front-run by liquidation once the loan is past maturity + overduePeriod.
///
/// COLLATERAL
/// @dev Iris lets borrowers withdraw collateral up to the underlying venue's LLTV edge. It only checks that
/// the remaining collateral covers the borrower's debt, fixed interest through maturity + overduePeriod, and
/// any bad bond. Managing venue health is the borrower's responsibility.
/// @dev Once the loan is liquidatable, withdrawCollateral reverts, so a borrower cannot withdraw against a
/// pending liquidation.
/// @dev The reserve is the projected liquidation exposure: fixed interest through the liquidation window, or
/// the floating leg beyond the bond if that is larger. Fixed interest accruing shrinks the bad bond one-for-one,
/// so the two are never summed.
/// @dev The withdrawCollateral check counts interest only through maturity + overduePeriod, but interest
/// keeps accruing until the loan is closed. Interest accruing between liquidation becoming possible and
/// being executed is therefore unchecked. It is expected to be small and covered by the venue LLTV buffer.
/// @dev To withdraw the full collateral, repay the loan then escape, since escape exits the live venue
/// balance. A full-amount withdrawCollateral can revert when underlying-venue rounding leaves the stored
/// amount above the real balance.
///
/// LIQUIDATION
/// @dev Once the loan passes maturity + overduePeriod, it becomes liquidatable.
/// @dev The overdue-liquidation Liquidation Incentive Factor (LIF) grows linearly from 0 (no bonus) at
/// maturity + overduePeriod to MAX_LIF over ~15 minutes (TIME_TO_MAX_LIF).
/// @dev When the remaining venue collateral is less than the full seize amount (repaid plus bonus), seized
/// is capped at the available collateral and the liquidator receives a reduced or zero bonus. When the cap binds
/// and the collateral has accrued ~no yield, supply-share rounding can leave stored collateral a wei above the
/// real venue balance and revert the seize transfer; repay then closes the loan.
/// @dev The liquidation incentive is capped, while venue debt may keep accruing after overduePeriod.
/// Deeply overdue loans can become uneconomic to liquidate.
///
/// BOND
/// @dev Bad bond is when the negative net (floating minus fixed) outgrows the whole bond, so the bond cannot
/// cover the solver's settlement at close. It requires realized divergence beyond the BLM's bond sizing
/// (uncommon with conservative params).
/// @dev In case of bad bond, borrower bears the bad bond.
/// @dev Since the solver controls bond withdrawals, withdrawBond can leave the bond at the bondLltv edge, letting
/// the solver self-liquidate to exit the fixed position without penalty. It's accepted as the BLM sizes
/// bondRequirement with enough buffer that normal accrual does not immediately make the bond liquidatable.
/// @dev A rebase can slash the bond below bondRequirement. The bondRequirement is a withdrawal
/// floor, not a liquidation trigger. Bond liquidation opens only on drawdown.
/// @dev While a slash leaves the bond below bondRequirement on a loan that still has venue debt, the solver cannot
/// withdraw. its exit is repay. Once the venue debt is retired bondRequirement drops to zero and the floor no longer
/// applies.
/// @dev A rebase that zeroes the bond zeroes bondRequirement too, as a bond liquidation would, so a loan with a
/// non-zero bondRequirement always holds a non-zero bond. As on bond liquidation, the solver forfeits the surplus.
///
/// BOND LIQUIDATION
/// @dev Small positions may not be liquidated due to the liquidation incentive <= gas cost.
/// @dev The bond liquidation incentive factor is min(MAX_BOND_LIF, 1 / (1 - cursor * (1 - bondLltv)) - 1).
/// @dev After bond liquidation, the borrower's loan position sits on the underlying venue getting variable interest
/// rate.
/// @dev On bond liquidation the solver forfeits the surplus. It is not settled to the solver, and the
/// underlying collateral with its yield stays in the venue for the borrower, compensating the borrower for
/// being forced to variable rate. It stays tracked as the borrower's collateral, so the borrower can withdraw
/// it with withdrawCollateral until maturity + overduePeriod or close the venue position with escape at any time.
/// @dev On bond liquidation the bond covers two things: the settlement the solver owes (floatingLeg minus
/// fixedLeg), which repays the venue, and the liquidator bonus (seized). Both come out of the bond, so the
/// solver pays the incentive. The borrower bears bad bond only when settlement plus bonus exceeds the bond.
/// @dev The loan position between solver and borrower pays fixed interest until the moment of the bond liquidation.
/// @dev Even in bad bond, bond liquidation incentive is still paid from the slashed bond. This may
/// increase the amount of bad bond. Otherwise the loan may stay open until maturity/overdue liquidation
/// while negative net keeps increasing.
/// @dev To remove bad bond, either solver supplies additional bond or borrower absorbs the bad bond
/// by repaying the debt including bad bond.
/// @dev Bond liquidation repays the venue with the settlement portion of the slashed bond, capped at the
/// current venue debt. If that portion is larger than the venue debt (for example the venue debt was already
/// mostly repaid), the leftover stays in Iris with no owner and counts as a donation.
///
/// REFINANCE
/// @dev It's only possible to refinance to whitelisted markets (enabled data).
/// @dev The borrower does not constrain which enabled market a refinance selects, so any enabled data
/// matching the loan's tokens can be bound to any loan on that venue. enableData must therefore only admit
/// markets whose oracle and lltv are acceptable for every loan that can reach them.
/// @dev The CEI pattern is not enforced given the token (non-reentrant), venue and its adapter is trusted.
/// @dev Refinance may introduce venue rounding dust: collateral can round down and debt can round up.
/// Repeated invocations can slightly worsen the position, but this is economically infeasible due to gas cost.
/// @dev One-sided collateral or debt changes directly on the venue before refinance
/// are not reconciled and remain governed by the external venue change assumptions.
/// @dev Refinance does not health-check the new market, so a solver can move the loan to a market whose
/// lltv or price leaves it immediately liquidatable on the underlying venue.
///
/// REBASE
/// @dev Rebase acts only when both venue collateral and venue debt have fallen below their expected values
/// (collateral + surplus, debt + floatingLeg), that is, a venue liquidation. A direct debt repay on a pod is out
/// of scope and may be treated as an unrecoverable donation. One that retires the venue debt before a liquidation is
/// rebased also zeroes bondRequirement, but stays unrecognized and cannot raise the refund.
/// @dev Recognized repayment over the principal is floating interest the borrower's collateral paid. It nets
/// against the fixed leg and the excess is refunded from the bond to the borrower's claimable, so the borrower does
/// not pay both legs on the recognized portion. The borrower is credited at most the value of the collateral they
/// lost. Repayment a seized surplus funded is not netted. Bond that cannot cover the excess is bad bond borne by the
/// borrower. The rebase that zeroes bondRequirement nets like any other, a venue wipe included. A loan whose
/// bondRequirement is already zero nets nothing.
/// @dev Live collateral above the tracked collateral and surplus is a direct venue supply. Rebase tracks it as
/// the borrower's collateral, so a withdrawal backed by it cannot pull tracked principal out of the surplus
/// base or the liquidation seize cap.
/// @dev Order is accrue, then rebase, then settle. Settlement runs on post-rebase (real venue) amounts, so the
/// solver's claimable for net and surplus can never exceed what the pod can actually withdraw.
/// @dev Legs accrue on the last synced collateral and debt, so after a venue liquidation they keep accruing
/// on stale bases until rebase runs. The longer the delay, the further settlement drifts. Any resulting
/// shift between borrower, solver, and bond is accepted.
/// @dev A direct collateral supply to a pod's venue position (by anyone) raises venueCollateral, which can zero
/// the liquidated term and make rebase skip a venue liquidation that occurred since the last sync.
/// @dev After a venue liquidation, Iris recognizes venue debt reduction against the debt-token
/// value of collateral lost since the last sync. A standard venue liquidation removes collateral
/// worth the repaid debt plus liquidation bonus while reducing venue debt only by the repaid debt,
/// so the liquidation-bonus buffer is the headroom for borrower direct venue repayment to be
/// recognized by rebase. Extra one-sided venue repayment is outside rebase.
/// @dev Rebase prices the lost collateral at the adapter's current oracle price, not at the price used
/// by the venue liquidation. Large price moves between the venue liquidation and the rebase call can change how much
/// debt reduction is recognized, how much paid floating is netted against the fixed leg and refunded from the bond,
/// and whether bad debt is detected.
/// @dev Debt that rebase does not recognize, from either cause above, leaves the stored debt above the real
/// venue debt. At close the closer repays the stored amount while only the venue debt is forwarded to the
/// venue, so the difference stays in Iris with no owner and counts as a donation.
/// @dev Surplus can be greater than the venue collateral in an extreme case where most of the collateral got
/// liquidated in the underlying venue. In such a case, the surplus shrinks to venue collateral.
/// @dev A zero bondRequirement means the solver's bond obligation is over, not that the loan is resolved. the
/// borrower may still owe the fixed leg and the pod may still hold the solver's surplus. Rebase zeroes it on bad debt,
/// on the venue debt being fully retired (the signal is venue debt because a third party can add collateral to a pod
/// but cannot borrow on it), or on a slash that exhausts the bond. From then on the solver can withdraw the bond even
/// when net is negative and surplus stops accruing. fixed leg and surplus outstanding are settled by repay or
/// liquidate, which stay callable while either remains. The loan is resolved once bondRequirement, debt, fixed leg
/// and surplus are all zero, which is what escape requires.
/// Surplus is forfeited only when the bond is gone (exhaustion, bond liquidation).
/// @dev If a bad-debt loan is nonetheless closed via repay or liquidate, legs settle normally and the
/// solver receives net and surplus, since the closer repays the debt and fixed interest in full.
///
/// POD
/// @dev No receive / fallback in pod. Rewards that are coming to pod will be handled offchain
/// and be directly accumulated to user.
/// @dev There can be dust (a few wei) tokens stranded in a pod due to the roundings.
///
/// VENUE ADAPTERS
/// @dev The adapter should not revert price.
/// @dev The adapter should not return 0 on price.
/// @dev The adapter should return a price with the correct scaling.
/// @dev Adapters that do not require data, such as Aave, require enabling keccak256("") before use.
/// @dev venueAdapter can be updated even for active loans.
/// @dev Iris stores venue index snapshots as uint128. adapters must not return indexes above that bound.
/// With a 1e27 base index, the cap is ~3.4e11x accumulated borrow-index growth.
/// @dev Invariant `index >= lastIndex`: borrow interest only raises the venue debt index. A bad-debt
/// liquidation lowers it by at most a `toAssetsUp` rounding (<=1 unit) that interest covers within a
/// block. The IRM's approximate average rate can also dip the index on a long-unwritten, near-idle
/// market. Whitelisting only blue-chip markets excludes that state. Hence the unchecked index deltas
/// never underflow.
/// @dev An idle Aave reserve with a nonzero base rate keeps growing its reported index while the stored index
/// does not move until the first borrow, so a take on it snapshots a higher index than the one the pod's debt
/// is minted at. Do not use Aave debt assets that can reach that state.
///
/// TOKEN REQUIREMENTS
/// @dev List of assumptions on the token that guarantees that the token behaves as expected:
/// - It should be ERC-20 compliant, except that it can omit return values on transfer and transferFrom.
/// - The token balance should only decrease on transfer and transferFrom. In particular, tokens with
/// burn functions are not supported.
/// - It should not re-enter the Iris on transfer or transferFrom.
/// - The balance of the sender (resp. receiver) should decrease (resp. increase) by exactly the given amount on
/// transfer and transferFrom. In particular, tokens with fees on transfer are not supported.
///
/// FEES
/// @dev Fee unit is WAD.
/// @dev This invariant holds for the fee: fee != 0 => feeRecipient != address(0).
/// @dev This invariant will be ensured by the team.
///
/// LIVENESS
/// @dev If an underlying venue oracle reverts on price or returns 0 price, functions requiring collateral valuation
/// may revert, including liquidate, withdrawCollateral, and rebase.
/// @dev If an underlying venue oracle returns a price such that the user's collateral quoted in debt token is
/// greater than type(uint128).max, then liquidate could revert.
/// @dev If a token sent/pulled by Iris reverts or returns false on transfer/transferFrom, related function will
/// revert when it tries to send/pull that token.
/// @dev If the underlying venue pauses or blocks repay/withdraw/exit, Iris has no bypass and related
/// functions may revert until the venue is live again.
///
/// MISC
/// @dev Iris trusts the venue adapter's price and lltv for collateral valuation. No extra oracle
/// staleness check or fair-value bound is applied.
/// @dev NatSpec comments are included only when they bring clarity.
/// @dev The amount of token supplied and borrowed should not be too high (max ~1e32), otherwise the numbers
/// might not fit within 128 bits.
/// @dev If MAX_FIXED_RATE or MAX_OVERDUE_RATE changes, keep their sum within type(uint16).max * BP.
/// @dev fixedLeg, floatingLeg and surplus are not up to date. Use accrueLegsView to get the up-to-date values.
/// @dev Expect owner to be a timelock contract.
